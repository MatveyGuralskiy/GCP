# Cloud Functions (Lambda AWS)
Is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With Cloud Functions you write single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services. Your function is triggered when an event being watched is fired

I created 2 functions for example:

1. Creates Bucket

2. Run Serverless Website
